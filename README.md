Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis is to draw conclusions and visualiza data based of the dataset given by the client, \"Kickstarter_Challenge_.xlsx"\.
---
In this challenge, I tried to help Louise understand how other campaigns did by comparing their launch dates to their fundraising goals. The goal of this challenge was to organize the information iv various types of tables and graphs in order to make visualize readable and present to the client.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- After creating the graph, we are able to visually find the trends in the data. From the graph, we can tell December is the worst time to launch a campaign, since almost 50% failed. Meanwhile, May and June are the best times to launch. All the other months are about the same amounts. From the graph, we can also gather that cancellations are flat, or less than 3% which is not very significant.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- On the "Outcomes Based on Goals" graph, we can see a clear relationship between the failed and successful campaings. As the goal gets high, failed and successful have an inversed relationship. We can also say the data from the goal ranges (1,000 to 25,000) is real and as you ask for more money you have less of a chance of succeeding. We can also notice that most plays are launched with a goal of less than 20,000. Plays campaigns might failed but they are never canceled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- Some of the challenges encountered in the data is that for many of the campaigns goals, there is not enough data for it to be valuable. The data we can offer is limited to the graphs. We could run some other graphs, to find if all other campaigns fall the same way in Decemeber and possibly find a correlation. We could also build other graphs to find if during May and June theater is competing with other campaigns; a hypothesis could be that it does so well during these two months because they are not competing against any other campaigns.
