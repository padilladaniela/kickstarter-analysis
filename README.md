In this challenge, I tried to help Louise understand how other campaigns did by comparing their launch dates to their fundraising goals.The goal of this challenge was to organize the information iv vearious types of tables and graphs in order to make visualize readable and present to the client. We are able to perform this analyssis by creating a sheet in [Kickstarter_Challenge] (desktop\# Kickstart_Challange_.xlsx), named \"Outcomes Based on Launch Date"\.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- After creating the graph, we are able to visually find the trends in the data. From the graph, we can tell December is the worst time to launch a campaign, since almost 50% failed. Meanwhile, May and June are the best times to launch. All the other months are about the same amounts.
